# Role Permissions

## Overview

The system uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions for different types of users.
Each role has a defined set of actions they are allowed to perform within the MediLink platform.

Currently, the platform supports three roles:

1. **Patient**
2. **Hospital Staff**
3. **Ambulance Driver**

Permissions ensure that users can only access features relevant to their responsibilities.
